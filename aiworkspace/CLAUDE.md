# AI Workspace - Strategy Review Guidelines

This directory contains strategy documentation for significant code changes and features. These documents serve as a reference for peer review and implementation validation.

## Purpose

The AI Workspace provides:
1. A central location for reviewing proposed code strategies before implementation
2. Documentation for complex technical solutions
3. A framework for collaborative review and improvement of significant changes

## Review Guidelines

When reviewing strategy documents in this workspace, please evaluate them against the following criteria:

### 1. Code Structure and Maintainability

- **Consistency**: Does the proposed solution follow existing code structures and patterns?
- **Modularity**: Is the solution properly compartmentalized to avoid tight coupling?
- **Naming Conventions**: Do the proposed variables, functions, and components follow the project's naming conventions?
- **Documentation**: Is the solution well-documented with comments where appropriate?
- **Testability**: Can the proposed changes be easily tested?

### 2. Security and Performance

- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Does the solution introduce any potential security issues?
- **Data Validation**: Are all inputs properly validated and sanitized?
- **Performance Impact**: How will the changes affect loading times, memory usage, and overall performance?
- **Resource Usage**: Does the solution efficiently use system resources?
- **Optimization Opportunities**: Are there areas where the solution could be further optimized?

### 3. Implementation Impact

- **Scope of Changes**: How extensive are the required modifications to the existing codebase?
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Will the changes break existing functionality?
- **Dependencies**: Does the solution introduce new dependencies?
- **Rollback Strategy**: How easily can the changes be reversed if issues arise?
- **Migration Path**: Is there a clear path for implementing these changes with minimal disruption?

### 4. User Experience

- **Accessibility**: Does the solution maintain or improve accessibility?
- **Browser Compatibility**: Will it work consistently across all supported browsers?
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: How does the solution behave on different device sizes?
- **Performance Perception**: Will users perceive any change in performance?

### 5. Edge Cases and Error Handling

- **Edge Case Coverage**: Does the solution handle all potential edge cases?
- **Graceful Degradation**: How will the system behave when things go wrong?
- **Error Messaging**: Are error messages clear and helpful?
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Can the system recover from failures?

## Feedback Process

When providing feedback on strategy documents:

1. Use constructive, specific language
2. Suggest alternatives when identifying issues
3. Consider both immediate and long-term implications
4. Prioritize feedback based on potential impact
5. Reference relevant parts of the existing codebase when applicable

## Implementation Verification

After implementation, the original strategy document should be referenced to verify:

1. All key components of the strategy were implemented
2. Any deviations from the strategy were necessary and documented
3. The implementation successfully addresses the original problem
4. No new issues were introduced

## Template Structure

Strategy documents should generally follow this structure:

1. **Problem Statement**: Clear definition of the issue being addressed
2. **Solution Strategy**: High-level approach to solving the problem
3. **Implementation Details**: Specific code changes and technical approach
4. **Testing Recommendations**: How to verify the solution works
5. **Future Considerations**: Potential improvements or related changes

By following these guidelines, we can ensure that major changes to the codebase are well-structured, secure, performant, and minimally disruptive.
