# Sermon Timestamps & Transcripts

This guide covers how to effectively use the timestamp and transcript features in CP Sermon Library to enhance the user experience and increase engagement with your sermon content.

## Understanding Sermon Timestamps

Timestamps allow listeners to navigate to specific points within a sermon audio or video file. This feature is particularly useful for longer sermons or when users want to revisit specific topics discussed.

### Adding Timestamps to Sermons

1. Edit the sermon you want to add timestamps to
2. In the Sermon Details panel, locate the "Timestamps" section
3. Click "Add Timestamp" 
4. Enter the timestamp in one of these formats:
   - `mm:ss` (e.g., 12:34)
   - `hh:mm:ss` (e.g., 1:12:34)
5. Enter a description for the timestamp point (e.g., "Introduction to Romans 8")
6. Add additional timestamps as needed
7. Save the sermon

### Timestamp Best Practices

- **Consistent Formatting**: Use consistent descriptions and formatting across sermons
- **Key Points**: Mark significant moments or topic transitions
- **Scripture References**: Always timestamp when a new scripture passage is introduced
- **Series Consistency**: For sermon series, use similar timestamp points across different sermons
- **Special Moments**: Include timestamps for testimonies, worship segments, or Q&A portions

### Quick Edit Timestamps

You can quickly add or edit timestamps using the Quick Edit feature:

1. From the sermons list, hover over a sermon and click "Quick Edit"
2. Locate the Timestamps field
3. Enter timestamps in the format: `time|description, time|description`
   - Example: `05:30|Introduction, 12:45|First Point, 23:15|Application`
4. Click "Update" to save

## Managing Sermon Transcripts

Transcripts make your sermon content searchable, accessible, and optimized for SEO.

### Transcript Creation Methods

CP Sermon Library provides several ways to create and manage transcripts:

#### Manual Transcript Entry

1. Edit the sermon
2. Navigate to the "Transcript" tab in the sermon editor
3. Enter or paste the transcript text
4. Use the formatting tools to structure the content
5. Save the sermon

#### YouTube Transcript Import

For sermons with YouTube videos:

1. Add the YouTube video URL to the sermon's Video URL field
2. Navigate to the "Transcript" tab
3. Click "Import from YouTube"
4. Review and edit the imported transcript as needed
5. Save the sermon

#### OpenAI Integration for Transcript Enhancement (Pro Feature)

If you have the Pro version with OpenAI integration:

1. Navigate to Library → Settings → Advanced
2. Enable "OpenAI Integration"
3. Enter your OpenAI API key
4. Configure transcript quality settings
5. Use the "Format with AI" button when viewing a rough transcript

### Transcript Formatting Tips

- **Speaker Identification**: Use bold formatting or labels for different speakers
- **Paragraph Breaks**: Include paragraph breaks for readability
- **Scripture References**: Format scripture quotations distinctly
- **Headings**: Use headings to mark major sections
- **Time Markers**: Consider including timestamps within the transcript

### Transcript Display Options

Control how transcripts appear on your site:

1. Navigate to Library → Settings → Item
2. Find the "Transcript Settings" section
3. Configure options:
   - Transcript tab label
   - Default display state (expanded/collapsed)
   - Search indexing options
   - Typography settings

## Using Timestamps and Transcripts Together

Combining these features creates a powerful user experience:

### Linking Timestamps to Transcript Sections

With the Pro version, you can link timestamps directly to transcript sections:

1. Edit the sermon
2. Make sure both timestamps and transcript are added
3. In the transcript, highlight a section of text
4. Click the "Link to Timestamp" button
5. Select the appropriate timestamp
6. Save the sermon

This creates a synchronized experience where clicking a timestamp not only jumps to that point in the media but also highlights the corresponding transcript section.

### SEO Benefits

Proper use of timestamps and transcripts provides SEO advantages:

- Increased content indexing by search engines
- Better ranking for specific sermon topics
- Enhanced "time to content" metrics
- Potential for featured snippets in search results
- Improved accessibility ratings

   - Search response time
   - Result highlighting
   - Search scope (current sermon or all sermons)

### Transcript Downloads

Allow users to download transcripts:

1. Navigate to Library → Settings → Item
2. Enable "Downloadable Transcripts"
3. Configure download options:
   - File format (PDF, DOCX, or both)
   - Include sermon metadata
   - Custom PDF styling

### Automated Workflows

Create an automated transcript workflow:

1. Upload sermon video to YouTube
2. Import the sermon details to CP Library
3. Use the YouTube transcript import feature
4. Enhance with OpenAI formatting (Pro)
5. Review and publish

## Troubleshooting Transcripts and Timestamps

### Common Timestamp Issues

## Best Practices for Accessibility

Using timestamps and transcripts improves your content's accessibility:

- Provides alternative access for hearing-impaired users
- Enables non-native speakers to follow along more easily
- Allows users to consume content in text form when audio isn't an option
- Meets WCAG guidelines for media accessibility

For maximum accessibility:

1. Always provide accurate timestamps for key points
2. Include full transcripts for all sermons
3. Ensure transcript text is properly formatted with speaker identification
4. Consider adding descriptive text for any visual elements referenced in sermons
