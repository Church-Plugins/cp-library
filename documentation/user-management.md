# User Management & Permissions

## Role-Based Access Control

CP Sermon Library integrates with WordPress user roles to control access to sermon management features.

### Default Permission Structure

The plugin uses the following WordPress capabilities:

- **Administrator** - Full access to all sermon features
- **Editor** - Can create, edit, and delete sermons, series, and speakers
- **Author** - Can create and edit their own sermons
- **Contributor** - Can create sermons but not publish them
- **Subscriber** - No sermon management capabilities

## Managing Contributor & Admin Permissions

You can adjust permissions for sermon management using role management plugins or by customizing capabilities.

### Key Capabilities

- `edit_cpl_items` - Ability to edit sermons
- `publish_cpl_items` - Ability to publish sermons
- `edit_others_cpl_items` - Ability to edit sermons created by others
- `delete_cpl_items` - Ability to delete sermons
- `manage_cpl_taxonomies` - Ability to manage sermon categories

### Restricting Access to Settings

By default, only administrators can access the plugin settings. This behavior ensures that critical configurations aren't changed accidentally.
